I have adapted the ideas and language from the work of several educators for this syllabus, and I appreciate their contributions to this syllabus. The language concerning Universal Learning is courtesy of the "Accessibility Statements on Syllabuses" on the ProfHacker blog (http://bit.ly/1bAXeDN). The language concerning the respective responsibilities of professor and students is courtesy of Dr. Terry Murray of the State University of New York at New Paltz. Language concerning definitions of Teaching for Understanding terms is from the Harvard Graduate School of Education Active Learning Practice for Schools website (http://learnweb.harvard.edu/alps/tfu/). The Unit Maps are based on the graphic organizer in the Teaching for Understanding Guide by Tina Blythe and Associates. All comics panels are from Cat and Girl by Dorothy Gambrell (http://catandgirl.com).
