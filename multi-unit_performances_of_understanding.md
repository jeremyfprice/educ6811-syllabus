# Multi-Unit Performances of Understanding

*Multi-Unit Culminating Performances* are opportunities for you to draw across all of your learning experiences to create an artifact of your understandings. They are longer and more involved projects and papers.

##Qualitative Ego-Centered Social Network Analysis

*Required for C, B, and A level work*

You will interview one of your colleagues and construct a "map" (using diagrams *and* words) of the social network that they rely on for specific purposes (an intentional social network). This is not only a way for you to gain insight into how social networks form and operate, but also a way to support a colleague recognize the social networks they can draw upon. *Expected Page Length:* 3-5 pages

##Community Analysis

*Required for B and A level work*

Using the Communities of Practice framework, you will analyze some sort of small learning community. You may be a part of the community, or it may be a community of which you are not a part. Some examples include a PLC, a work group, a team, or a club. You will identify the ways in which the identities, practices, and meanings are negotiated, and the ways in which new members move to central roles in the community. *Expected Page Length:* 5-10 pages

##Community Plan

*Required for A level work*

Drawing upon the various ideas, frameworks, discussions, and readings from the course, you will develop a plan for building, facilitating, and sustaining a learning community in the digital age. Again, you may be a part of the community, or it may be a community of which you are not a part. This plan will give you the opportunity to delve deeply into one particular framework or idea, or to synthesize more broadly across the course as a whole. *Expected Page Length:* 5-10 pages.

##Learning Community Reflection

*Required for C, B, and A level work*

Reflecting on your learning and experience is an important step in learning. You are to bring the ideas, frameworks, discussions, and readings for the course and identify how your thinking about learning communities and technologies has changed. *Expected Page Length:* 5-7 pages
