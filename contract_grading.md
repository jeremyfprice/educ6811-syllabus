# Contract Grading

##What is Contract Grading?

This is a contract graded course. This means that, as a graduate student, you decide what grade you will work towards over the course of the semester. You can always renegotiate your grade at any time during the semester.

You will be provided with a [single point rubric](http://www.cultofpedagogy.com/holistic-analytic-single-point-rubrics/) for each major Performance of Understanding. The rubric provides the requirements for satisfactory graduate-level work. I will provide feedback for you on the areas in which you exceeded and areas of concern. **If your work does not meet the satisfactory level, you may revise and resubmit your work within one week of receiving feedback.**

The requirements for a grade of C, B and A are outlined below. Note that "A student may earn only two grades of C in all graduate courses, and remain eligible for graduation" ([Academic Policies for Graduate Students](https://www.fairmontstate.edu/graduatestudies/academic-policies)). **Contracting for a C is not recommended if you are working towards a degree.**
