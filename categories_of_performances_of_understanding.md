# Categories of Performances of Understanding

There are four categories of performances of understanding in this course which provide a system of on-going assessment and feedback for students: 

* **Tip of Your Iceberg**: Activities that precede or complement (your choice) the readings, designed to help elicit your existing understandings of the concepts of the unit;
* **Making Connections**: Opportunities to connect the theories and ideas embedded in the readings with your own experiences and with potential future contexts through dialogue and practice with your peers and your professor;
•	Looking Back, Looking Ahead: Structured activity to help you make sense and meaning of the readings and activities of the unit, as well as an opportunity to compare your outgoing ideas and thoughts with your pre-existing ideas and thoughts;
•	Multi-Unit Culminating Performance: Opportunities for you to draw across all of your learning experiences to create an artifact of your understandings.
